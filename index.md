## About Me

I am currently an Associate Professor with School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou Univerisity. I received Ph.D degree in State Key Lab of Computer Aided Design and Computer Graphics at Zhejiang University in June 2013. I worked as a research engineer in the Media Technology Laboratory of HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD. from July 2013 to December 2014. My research interests mainly focus on artificial intelligence, computer graphics and smart hearthcare. I have published more than 40 papers in important academic journals such as IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, Pattern Recognition, Computer Graphics Forum, and important international academic conferences including CVPR, IJCAI, ACM MM et al.
