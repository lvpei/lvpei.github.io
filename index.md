## About Me

I received Ph.D degree in State Key Lab of Computer Aided Design and Computer Graphics at Zhejiang University in June 2013. I worked as a research engineer in the Media Technology Laboratory of HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD. from July 2013 to December 2014. Currently, I am the deputy director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Information Science Research at Zhengzhou University. I have presided over 6 national and provincial scientific research projects including the National Science Foundation of China, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, the Opening Project of State Key Lab of CAD&CG of Zhejiang University et al. My research results are mainly embodied in high-level research papers, valuable patents, efficient algorithmic libraries, important software systems and equipment. I have published more than 30 papers in important academic journals such as IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, Pattern Recognition, Neurocomputing, IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, Computer Graphics Forum, IEEE Multimedia, The Visual Computer, Journal of Computer-Aided Design & Computer Graphics and Journal of Image and Graphics, and important international academic conferences including ACM MM, Pacific Graphics and Computer Graphics International Conference.
