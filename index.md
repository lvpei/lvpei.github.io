## About Me

I am currently a Full Professor and Vice Dean with School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Zhengzhou Univerisity. I received Ph.D degree in State Key Lab of Computer Aided Design and Computer Graphics at Zhejiang University in June 2013. I worked as a research engineer in the Media Technology Laboratory of HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD. from July 2013 to December 2014. My research interests mainly focus on artificial intelligence, virtual reality and exoskeleton robots. I have published more than 60 papers in important academic journals such as IEEE TIP, IEEE TVCG, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE T-CYB, IEEE TAC, Pattern Recognition, and important international academic conferences including CVPR, ECCV, IJCAI, ACM MM et al.
